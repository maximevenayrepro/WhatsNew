# AI Task Planning Template - Starter Framework

---

## 1. Task Overview

### Task Title
**Title:** Polish README and ARCHITECTURE.md documentation

### Goal Statement
**Goal:** Ensure README.md is user-focused (setup, install, run, features) and ARCHITECTURE.md contains all technical details (models, services, API, architecture).

---

## 2. Project Analysis & Current State

### Technology & Architecture
- **Frameworks & Versions:** FastAPI, Uvicorn
- **Language:** Python 3.11+, JavaScript (ES6)

### Current State
Documentation structure exists but needs final review and polish for completeness.

---

## 3. Context & Problem Definition

### Problem Statement
Documentation must be split: README.md for users (setup, run, features), ARCHITECTURE.md for developers (technical details, models, services).

### Success Criteria
- [ ] `README.md` contains only user-facing content (install, run, features)
- [ ] `ARCHITECTURE.md` contains all technical details (models, services, API, architecture)
- [ ] Both files are complete and up-to-date with current implementation

---

## 4. Development Mode Context
Local prototype; keep instructions minimal and accurate.

---

## 5. Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- README.md: project description, features list, installation, configuration, run instructions
- ARCHITECTURE.md: tech stack, data models, services, API endpoints, security, file structure
- Clear separation of concerns between both files

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Keep both files concise and skimmable
- Use consistent formatting and structure

### Technical Constraints
- No secrets in examples or documentation

---

## 6. Data & Database Changes
None.

---

## 7. API & Backend Changes
None.

---

## 8. Frontend Changes
None.

---

## 9. Implementation Plan
- Review and polish `README.md` for user-facing completeness
- Review and polish `ARCHITECTURE.md` for technical completeness
- Ensure both files accurately reflect current implementation

---

## 10. Task Completion Tracking
- Both files reviewed and complete
- Clear separation between user docs (README) and technical docs (ARCHITECTURE)

### Documentation Updates
- Update `README.md` only for user-facing changes (features, installation, run instructions)
- Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` for technical changes (data models, services, API endpoints, architecture)

---

## 11. File Structure & Organization
- `README.md` (user-facing)
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (technical)

---

## 12. AI Agent Instructions
1) Review both files for completeness
2) Ensure proper separation of concerns
3) Update any outdated information

---

## 13. Second-Order Impact Analysis
Reduces onboarding friction and errors.
