# Post-Task Compliance Review

## Overview
This rule requires a short pass over all `.cursor` rules after each task execution or file change to ensure the work is compliant and complete before proceeding.

## Rule: Re-check `.cursor` rules after every change
1. **Always** review applicable `.cursor` guidelines immediately after completing a task, commit, or file edit.
2. **Fix** any non-compliance before moving on (naming, typing, comments, docs, performance, security, etc.).
3. **Update** documentation, tests, and examples when behavior, endpoints, or configurations change.

## Scope
- Code, comments, and docstrings
- Documentation and README/run instructions
- Configuration, secrets handling, and CORS
- API contracts, error shapes, and logging
- Frontend UI text and accessibility
- Performance and network behavior
- File sizes and structure conventions

## Quick Checklist for the Assistant
- [ ] English-only content respected
- [ ] Naming and typing conventions followed
- [ ] Comments and docstrings clear and necessary
- [ ] Source file length/structure within guidance
- [ ] API errors and logging consistent and actionable
- [ ] Secrets/config and CORS safe and correct
- [ ] Performance/network sane defaults and no obvious regressions
- [ ] Frontend UI accessibility and visible text compliant
- [ ] README/runbook updated if needed

## When You Think You Need Exceptions
Document the exception inline and in the commit message. Prefer adjusting the implementation to meet the rules rather than bypassing them. Revisit and remove exceptions when no longer needed.
